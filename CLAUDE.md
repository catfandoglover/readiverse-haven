ALWAYS refer to my plan /Users/philip.galebach/coding-projects/alexandria/readiverse-haven/MCP/plan.md. 

ONLY EVER COMPLETE ONE TASK AT A TIME. ALWAYS ASK FOR GUIDANCE AFTER COMPLETING A TASK. just add (completed) to the task number when done. do not do a git commit also told to. 

- For all of my supabase tables and their relationships refer to /Users/philip.galebach/coding-projects/alexandria/readiverse-haven/DOCS/Supabase/supabase_db_diagram.mmd
