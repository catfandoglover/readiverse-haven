# Notes on Supabase Edge Functions

- **Local deployment crucial**: Must deploy using Supabase CLI with Docker locally
- **Deployment verification issues**:
  - Errors often go unreported
  - Function may silently fail to update (using old versions)
  
- **Best practice**: Delete edge function completely before redeploying
  - Example: Environmental variable issues may not trigger error flags

- **Deployment location**: Always deploy from local computer using supabase CLI 

- **Environmental variables**: Functions seem to pull from local `.env` files
  - Exact mechanism unclear but confirmed they access local `.env` at times as well as supabase' edge functions secrets

- **Critical deployment requirements**:
  1. Must be publicly accessible (requires config file)
  2. Must deploy with JWT verification disabled
     - Use option: "jwt disabled" 
     - Otherwise function can't check tokens (initially receives outseta, not valid Supabase JWT)

     "supabase functions deploy exchange --no-verify-jwt"
