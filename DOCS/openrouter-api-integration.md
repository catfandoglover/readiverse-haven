# OpenRouter API Security Implementation

## Overview

To improve security for our OpenRouter API integration, we have implemented a secure pattern using Supabase Edge Functions to store and retrieve API keys, similar to our Gemini API integration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Edge Function for API Key

A new edge function `get-openrouter-key` has been created that securely provides the OpenRouter API key to the frontend application. The key is stored as an environment variable in the Supabase deployment, never exposed in client-side code.

**Path:** `supabase/functions/get-openrouter-key/index.ts`

This function:
- Retrieves the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from Supabase edge function environment variables
- Returns it securely to authenticated clients
- Handles CORS and error cases properly

### 2. OpenRouterService

We've created a new `OpenRouterService` class that handles:
- Securely fetching the API key from the edge function
- Managing the API key state
- Providing a clean interface for making OpenRouter API calls

**Path:** `src/services/OpenRouterService.ts`

## Usage

To use the OpenRouter API in your component:

```typescript
import openRouterService from '../services/OpenRouterService';

// Then in your component:
async function makeOpenRouterRequest() {
  try {
    const response = await openRouterService.generateChatCompletion(
      [
        { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
        { role: 'user', content: 'Tell me about philosophy' }
      ],
      'anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet',
      { temperature: 0.7 }
    );
    
    // Handle the response
    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling OpenRouter:', error);
  }
}
```

## Security Benefits

1. **API Key Protection**: The OpenRouter API key is never exposed in client-side code
2. **Centralized Management**: API keys are managed in one place (Supabase edge function secrets)
3. **Access Control**: The edge function can implement additional authorization checks
4. **Key Rotation**: Keys can be rotated without client-side code changes
5. **No Impact on DNA Assessment**: This implementation is completely separate from the DNA assessment functionality

## Development Setup

For local development:

1. Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable in Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxx
   ```

2. For local development without edge functions, you can also set it in `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxx
   ```

## Implementation Phases

The implementation followed a careful phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Created the edge function and service separately from existing code
2. **Phase 2**: Added documentation
3. **Phase 3**: Test the implementation without affecting existing functionality

## DNA Assessment Safety

This implementation has been designed with special attention to not affect the DNA assessment functionality:

1. No existing code files were modified
2. The new service and edge function are completely separate
3. The existing environment variables remain unchanged
4. The DNA assessment edge functions continue to work as before
