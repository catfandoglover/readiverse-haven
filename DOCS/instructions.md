review my app in depth. gain a very good understanding of how it currently works and what it's current functionality is. It's important to note that most of the screens I want are there. 

the thing that is missing is the conditional logic to only show some screens to certain types of users (eg logged in, with DNA assessment, without DNA assessment)

I already have auth with outseta. 

your task is to create a clear easy to follow step by step list of tasks to implement the things that are in my PRD /Users/philip.galebach/coding-projects/alexandria/readiverse-haven/DOCS/user-flow-diagrams/user-flow-complete.md but are not yet in the app. 

specifically when to route a user to a particular screen. what screens to show. how to save these differernt states. create that plan. save your plan here.

the plan should mention what files specifically will need to be updated for each task.

eg task 1 update navigation options based on user's logged in and DNA assessment state.
