# Vercel Serverless Function Fixes

## Issue Summary
The AI chat functionality was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error when deployed to Vercel. The error occurred in the `/api/chat` endpoint when trying to communicate with the Google Gemini API.

## Root Causes
1. Improper request payload formatting for the Gemini API
2. Inadequate error handling and logging
3. Potential environment variable configuration issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `/api/chat.ts` Serverless Function
- Improved request payload formatting for the Gemini API
- Enhanced error handling with better error messages
- Added more detailed logging to help with debugging
- Fixed response parsing to properly extract the AI response

### 2. Updated `AIService.ts`
- Improved the `_formatMessagesForGemini` method to ensure proper formatting
- Enhanced error handling in the `generateResponse` method
- Fixed response parsing to avoid "body already read" errors
- Improved logging with truncated payloads to avoid excessive log sizes

### 3. Added Environment Variable Verification
- Created a new `/api/check-env.ts` endpoint to verify environment variables
- This can be used to check if the API keys are properly configured in Vercel

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Added detailed information about required environment variables to README.md
- Included step-by-step instructions for setting up Vercel deployment

## Required Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for Polly (typically 'us-east-1')
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key

## Deployment Steps
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Test the `/api/check-env` endpoint to verify environment variables
4. Test the AI chat functionality

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check the Vercel Function Logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that the API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions
3. Ensure the request payload format matches the Gemini API requirements
4. Check for any rate limiting or quota issues with the Gemini API
