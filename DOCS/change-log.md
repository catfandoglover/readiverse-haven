I'll implement the plan for updating the app's navigation logic based on authentication and DNA assessment status. Let me start by examining the current code structure and making the necessary changes.

1. **Root Route Logic**:
   - Added a `RootRedirect` component that redirects users based on their authentication and DNA status:
     - Unauthenticated or no-DNA users → `/dna`
     - Users with completed DNA assessments → `/virgil`

2. **DNA Route Access Control**:
   - Added a `DnaRouteHandler` component that prevents users with completed DNA assessments from accessing the DNA assessment page:
     - Redirects users with DNA to `/virgil`
     - Shows the DNA assessment intro for other users

3. **Menu Visibility Logic**:
   - Updated `MainMenu.tsx` to show/hide menu items according to the rules in your image:
     - Intellectual DNA: Hidden for users with DNA, visible for others
     - Discover: Visible for all users
     - Virgil: Login prompt for unauthenticated, visible for all authenticated users, default for with-DNA users
     - Study: Login prompt for unauthenticated, visible for all authenticated users
     - Profile: Hidden for unauthenticated and no-DNA users, visible for with-DNA users

4. **Default Item Highlighting**:
   - Added logic to highlight the default menu item based on user status:
     - DNA for unauthenticated and no-DNA users
     - Virgil for with-DNA users

5. **Auth Provider Enhancements**:
   - Improved the DNA status check in the auth context:
     - Added an effect to automatically check DNA status when user or Supabase client changes
     - Added proper loading state management
     - Ensured `hasDNA` is correctly set based on the presence of `assessment_id` in the user's profile

These changes ensure the application behaves according to the visibility rules in your specification image:

1. For unauthenticated users:
   - Default landing page: DNA assessment
   - Discover: Shown
   - Virgil: Login prompt
   - Study: Login prompt
   - Profile: Hidden

2. For authenticated users without DNA assessment:
   - Default landing page: DNA assessment
   - Discover: Shown
   - Virgil: Shown
   - Study: Shown
   - Profile: Hidden

3. For authenticated users with DNA assessment:
   - Default landing page: Virgil
   - Discover: Shown
   - Virgil: Shown (default)
   - Study: Shown
   - Profile: Shown
   - DNA assessment: Hidden (redirected to Virgil)
