VIRGIL WELCOME


Let me search for specific implementations of the Virgil welcome chat.

Search files...
Yes, the Virgil welcome chat is currently implemented in the codebase. It's located in `src/pages/VirgilWelcome.tsx`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Component**: `VirgilWelcome`
   - A full-screen component that introduces users to Virgil after completing their DNA assessment

2. **Key Features**:
   - Initial welcome screen with "Meet Virgil" heading
   - Transitions to a chat interface after 2.5 seconds
   - Has a 2-minute timer for DNA results processing
   - Uses the `VirgilFullScreenChat` component for the chat interface

3. **States**:
   ```typescript
   const [state, setState] = useState<'initial' | 'transitioning' | 'chat'>('initial');
   const [resultsReady, setResultsReady] = useState(false);
   ```

4. **Flow**:
   - Shows initial welcome screen
   - After 2.5 seconds, transitions to chat interface
   - Displays initial message: "I'm Virgil, your philosophical guide to humanity's great conversation. Your intellectual DNA results are processing in our ideas lab. I'll let you know when they're ready. In the meantime, how was that experience for you?"
   - After 2 minutes, shows "results ready" message
   - When user clicks to view results, saves conversation and navigates to profile

5. **Key Code**:
```typescript
{state === 'chat' && (
  <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col">
    <VirgilFullScreenChat 
      variant="virgilchat"
      initialMessage="I'm Virgil, your philosophical guide to humanity's great conversation. Your intellectual DNA results are processing in our ideas lab. I'll let you know when they're ready. In the meantime, how was that experience for you?"
      resultsReady={resultsReady}
      onViewResults={handleViewResults}
      disableChat={resultsReady}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

6. **Results Handling**:
```typescript
const handleViewResults = async () => {
  try {
    // Save the conversation to Supabase
    const sessionId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15);
    await conversationManager.saveConversationToSupabase(
      sessionId,
      "dna-welcome",
      null, 
      "welcome"
    );
    navigate('/profile?tab=profile');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving conversation:', error);
    navigate('/profile?tab=profile');
  }
};
```

The welcome chat serves as the initial introduction to Virgil after a user completes their DNA assessment, providing a guided transition into the platform's philosophical guidance system.
