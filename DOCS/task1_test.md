# Checking Task 1 Implementation (ProtectedRoute Component)

To verify that Task 1 (creating the ProtectedRoute component) was implemented correctly, you should follow these steps:

## 1. File Existence Check

First, confirm that the file exists at the specified path:
```
/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx
```

## 2. Code Review

Review the implemented code against the specification to ensure:

- All imports are present (`useAuth`, `Navigate`, `useLocation`, `React`)
- The `ProtectedRouteProps` interface is defined correctly with the required properties
- The component is properly typed as a React functional component
- The logic for checking authentication and DNA assessment matches the requirements

## 3. Functionality Testing

The most thorough way to test is by verifying the component's behavior in different scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Unauthenticated User
- Try accessing a route protected with `requireAuth={true}`
- Verify you're redirected to `/login`
- Check that the original location is saved in the state

### Scenario 2: Authenticated User without DNA
- Log in with a user who hasn't completed DNA assessment
- Try accessing a route protected with `requireAuth={true}` and `requireDNA={true}`
- Verify you're redirected to `/dna/priming`

### Scenario 3: Authenticated User with DNA
- Log in with a user who has completed DNA assessment
- Try accessing a route protected with both requirements
- Verify you can access the protected content

### Scenario 4: Loading State
- Temporarily modify the auth context to keep `isLoading` true
- Verify the loading indicator appears when accessing protected routes

## 4. Integration Testing

Check that the ProtectedRoute component works correctly when integrated with your routing:

- Add the ProtectedRoute to a test route in your router
- Verify that the route behaves as expected with different user states
- Check that the component correctly passes children to the rendered output

## 5. Edge Cases

Test edge cases such as:
- What happens during authentication transitions
- How the component handles when local storage has a pending DNA assessment but the user object doesn't
- Browser refresh behavior with protected routes

By methodically going through these steps, you'll be able to verify that Task 1 was implemented correctly and that the ProtectedRoute component functions as intended in your application.
