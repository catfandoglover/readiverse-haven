# Deno Function Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents the changes made to fix TypeScript errors and runtime issues related to Deno imports and token exchange in the Supabase Edge Functions.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. `supabase/functions/exchange/index.ts`
- **Original TypeScript Fixes**: 
  - Changed the jose import from URL format to npm specifier format
  - Added TypeScript type reference path
  - Added proper type declarations for Request and Deno namespace
  - Fixed payload modification to create a new object instead of mutating the original
  - Added proper error handling with TypeScript type assertions

- **Runtime Fixes (March 2025)**:
  - Added `json()` method to Request interface type definition
  - Enhanced CORS headers with additional required fields
  - Added detailed logging throughout the function
  - Added support for receiving tokens via request body (alternative to Authorization header)
  - Improved JWT payload processing:
    - Added explicit `sub` field derived from available identifiers
    - Added explicit `aud` field set to "authenticated"
    - Added proper fallbacks for `iat` and `exp` fields
  - Enhanced error responses with more detail for troubleshooting

### 2. `src/integrations/supabase/token-exchange.ts`
- **Runtime Fixes (March 2025)**:
  - Implemented fallback mechanism that tries two methods to send the token:
    - First attempt: Send as Bearer token in Authorization header
    - Second attempt: Send token in request body if the first attempt fails
  - Improved error handling and logging

### 3. `supabase/functions/types/deno.d.ts`
- **Created**: New type declaration file
- **Purpose**: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Deno-specific modules
  - Includes declarations for the HTTP server module
  - Includes declarations for the jose JWT library
  - Resolves "Cannot find module" TypeScript errors

### 4. `supabase/functions/tsconfig.json`
- **Changes**:
  - Added typeRoots to include the custom type definitions
  - Included type declaration files in the compilation
  - Removed dependency on @supabase/supabase-js types

### 5. `supabase/functions/deno.jsonc`
- **Created**: Deno-specific configuration file
- **Purpose**:
  - Defines development and deployment tasks
  - Configures import maps for Deno modules
  - Sets up proper compiler options for Deno

## Technical Details of Token Exchange Process

1. **Client-Side**:
   - The client obtains an Outseta JWT token via Outseta authentication
   - The client sends this token to the Supabase Edge Function (exchange)
   - After receiving a Supabase JWT, it creates a Supabase client with this token
   
2. **Server-Side (Edge Function)**:
   - Receives the Outseta token via Authorization header or request body
   - Verifies the token using Outseta's JWKS endpoint
   - Creates a new JWT with a payload compatible with Supabase's expectations:
     - Sets `role` to "authenticated"
     - Ensures `sub` is present (using email or user_id as fallback)
     - Sets `aud` to "authenticated"
     - Signs using Supabase's JWT secret (SUPA_JWT_SECRET)
   - Returns the new Supabase-compatible JWT

3. **Token Format Requirements**:
   - The Supabase JWT must have:
     - A valid issuer (`iss`)
     - A subject (`sub`) that identifies the user
     - An audience (`aud`) set to "authenticated"
     - A role claim set to "authenticated"
     - Valid issuance and expiration times

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Issues**:
   - Edge functions require proper CORS headers
   - The function now supports OPTIONS preflight requests
   - Headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin and others

2. **Token Transmission**:
   - Some environments may strip Authorization headers
   - The system now supports token transmission via request body as a fallback

3. **JWT Verification Failures**:
   - Enhanced logging helps identify the specific verification failure
   - Payload now includes all required fields with fallbacks

## Deployment Notes
- The function should be deployed using `supabase functions deploy exchange`
- Required environment variables:
  - `OUTSETA_DOMAIN`: Outseta domain for JWT verification (e.g., "lightninginspiration.com")
  - `SUPA_JWT_SECRET`: Supabase JWT secret for signing tokens
- After deployment, try the token exchange with:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST https://myeyoafugkrkwcnfedlu.functions.supabase.co/exchange \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OUTSETA_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  curl -X POST https://myeyoafugkrkwcnfedlu.functions.supabase.co/exchange \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"token":"YOUR_OUTSETA_TOKEN"}'
  ```
