# Deno Function Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents the changes made to fix TypeScript errors related to Deno imports in the Supabase Edge Functions.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. `supabase/functions/exchange/index.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Changed the jose import from URL format to npm specifier format
  - Added TypeScript type reference path
  - Added proper type declarations for Request and Deno namespace
  - Fixed payload modification to create a new object instead of mutating the original
  - Added proper error handling with TypeScript type assertions

### 2. `supabase/functions/types/deno.d.ts`
- **Created**: New type declaration file
- **Purpose**: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Deno-specific modules
  - Includes declarations for the HTTP server module
  - Includes declarations for the jose JWT library
  - Resolves "Cannot find module" TypeScript errors

### 3. `supabase/functions/tsconfig.json`
- **Changes**:
  - Added typeRoots to include the custom type definitions
  - Included type declaration files in the compilation
  - Removed dependency on @supabase/supabase-js types

### 4. `supabase/functions/deno.jsonc`
- **Created**: Deno-specific configuration file
- **Purpose**:
  - Defines development and deployment tasks
  - Configures import maps for Deno modules
  - Sets up proper compiler options for Deno

## Reason for Changes
The original code was encountering TypeScript errors because standard TypeScript doesn't understand Deno's URL imports or npm: specifiers. The changes provide proper type declarations while maintaining the code's functionality when deployed to Supabase Edge Functions.

The TypeScript errors "Cannot find module" for Deno imports are expected in a regular TypeScript environment but don't affect the actual runtime functionality when deployed to Deno environments like Supabase Edge Functions.

## Deployment Notes
- The function should be deployed using `supabase functions deploy exchange`
- Required environment variables:
  - `OUTSETA_DOMAIN`: Outseta domain for JWT verification
  - `SUPA_JWT_SECRET`: Supabase JWT secret for signing tokens
