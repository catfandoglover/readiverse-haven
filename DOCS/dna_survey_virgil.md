# Survey Bot Branch Implementation Report

## Branch Purpose and Overview

The `survey_bot` branch implements an AI assistant system (named "Virgil") to help users explore philosophical questions in the DNA assessment. The system provides a conversational interface where users can discuss and reflect on the questions they're answering in the assessment.

The implementation addresses a critical issue where the original AI system was missing context about the actual questions being asked - it only had question IDs but not the question text itself. The branch fixes this issue by properly storing and passing the complete question text to the AI system.

## Key Features

1. **Context-Aware Conversations**:
   - The AI assistant is now aware of the current philosophical question being shown to the user
   - When a user changes to a new question, the system creates a fresh conversation with new context

2. **Dynamic Conversation Starters**:
   - Implements a system that selects random philosophical prompts when starting a new conversation
   - Each new question gets a different conversation starter to keep the experience fresh
   - Prompts are designed to be open-ended and encourage thoughtful reflection

3. **Audio Response System**:
   - All AI assistant responses are automatically converted to speech using AWS Polly
   - Implements auto-play functionality so audio responses begin playing immediately
   - Users can manually pause/play audio responses as needed

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Clear visual indicators when the AI is processing responses
   - Support for both text and voice input from users
   - Mobile-friendly interface with floating AI chat button

5. **Conversation Persistence**:
   - Saves conversation history to Supabase for future reference
   - Maintains question paths to provide context to the AI about previous answers

## File Changes

### Core Components Added

1. **`src/components/survey/AIChatButton.tsx`**
   - New component creating a floating button for accessing the AI assistant
   - Retrieves session ID from storage for conversation persistence

2. **`src/components/survey/AIChatDialog.tsx`**
   - Dialog component containing the chat interface
   - Manages the conversation state, message history, and audio interactions
   - Handles both text and voice message inputs

3. **`src/components/survey/ChatMessage.tsx`**
   - Component for rendering individual chat messages
   - Supports audio playback for assistant messages

### Core Services Added

1. **`src/services/AIService.ts`**
   - Client-side service for managing AI interactions
   - Integrates with Google's Gemini API for generating responses
   - Formats conversation history with proper context

2. **`src/services/ConversationManager.ts`**
   - Fixed the critical issue by storing the complete question text instead of just IDs
   - Manages conversation context across interactions
   - Maintains question paths and conversation history
   - Implements persistence to Supabase database

3. **`src/services/SpeechService.ts`**
   - Handles speech synthesis using AWS Polly
   - Converts text responses to audio for playback

4. **`src/services/AudioManager.ts`**, **`AudioContext.ts`** and **`AudioRecordingService.ts`**
   - Manages audio playback and recording
   - Enables voice inputs from users

### Other Significant Changes

1. **`src/components/reader/ReaderHeader.tsx`**
   - Modified to integrate the AI chat button

2. **`supabase/functions/analyze-dna/index.ts` and `prompts.ts`**
   - Updated to work with the AI service
   - Modified prompts for better context awareness

3. **`src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` and `types.ts`**
   - Updated to support the new conversation storage functionality

4. **Package Dependencies**
   - Added AWS SDK for Polly integration (`@aws-sdk/client-polly` and `@aws-sdk/polly-request-presigner`)
   - Added Zustand state management (`zustand`)
   - Adjusted Supabase version

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **AI Conversation Logic**:
   - The system now provides the complete question text (previously only had IDs) to the AI
   - Dynamic system prompts are generated based on current question context
   - Conversation history is properly maintained and provided as context

2. **Voice and Audio Implementation**:
   - Uses AWS Polly for text-to-speech conversion
   - Implements audio recording for voice input using browser APIs
   - Audio playback is handled through custom audio context management

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Conversations are stored in a new `dna_conversations` table in Supabase
   - Linked to assessment IDs for future reference
   - Supports anonymous users with fallback IDs

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Floating button interface for seamless integration
   - Visual feedback during processing states
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

## Bug Fixes

The primary issue fixed in this branch is addressing the problem described in `MCP/task.md`:

> The current implementation has a critical flaw that prevents the LLM from effectively using previous question/answer context:
> 1. When adding questions to the path, only the question ID and the answer label are stored
> 2. The actual question text is never stored in the question path, only the ID
> 3. When generating the dynamic system prompt, only meaningless IDs are passed to the LLM
> 4. The LLM has no way to know what "Question ID: Q1" actually means or what question was asked

This has been fixed by modifying the `ConversationManager.ts` to store the complete question text:

```typescript
// Before (in main branch)
conversationManager.addQuestionToPath(
  upperCategory.toLowerCase(), 
  currentPosition,  // Just the ID like "Q1" or "AAB"
  answer === 'yes' ? yesOption : noOption  // Just "Yes"/"No" or labels
);

// After (in survey_bot branch)
conversationManager.addQuestionToPath(
  sessionId,
  questionId,  
  question,  // The full question text is now stored
  answer  
);
```

And the system prompt generation now includes the actual questions and answers:

```typescript
// Before (in main branch)
for (const { questionId, answer } of questionPath) {
  dynamicPrompt += `- Question ID: "${questionId}"\n  Answer: ${answer}\n`;
}

// After (in survey_bot branch)
for (const { questionId, question, answer } of questionPath) {
  dynamicPrompt += `- Question: "${question}"\n  Answer: ${answer}\n`;
}
```

## Future Considerations

Based on `MCP/app.md`, future improvements planned for this branch include:

1. Add voice style customization options
2. Implement conversation history saving
3. Add more sophisticated context management to track user's philosophical leanings

## Conclusion

The `survey_bot` branch represents a significant enhancement to the DNA assessment experience by providing a context-aware AI assistant that can help users think through philosophical questions. The implementation fixes a critical issue with context management and adds rich audio functionality for a more interactive experience.
