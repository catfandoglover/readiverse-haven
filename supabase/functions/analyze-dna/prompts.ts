# Mythopoetic Archetype Generation System
## Core Components
### First Word Elements should describe the nature and/or state of the respondent based on their answer sequence

### Second Word Elements (Action/Role) should describe the action orientation of the respondent based on their answer sequence

## Integration Rules
1. Pattern Analysis:
\`\`\`
Analyze:
- Domain specific responses and how their responses across domains reflect their philosophical bent and action orientation
- Pattern sequence
- Domain context
\`\`\`
2. Element Selection:
\`\`\`
Choose first word based on:
- Pattern type
- Domain nature
- Overall profile
\`\`\`
3. Role Assignment:
\`\`\`
Choose second word based on:
- Action pattern
- Integration needs
- Profile balance
\`\`\`
4. Resonance Check:
\`\`\`
Verify:
- Metaphoric coherence
- Philosophical accuracy
- Poetic resonance
\`\`\`
## Quality Guidelines
1. Archetype Criteria:
- Must capture philosophical orientation
- Should feel mythologically resonant
- Should be immediately evocative
2. Combination Rules:
- Elements must complement
- Avoid redundancy
- Maintain metaphoric coherence
- Create clear image
3. Verification Steps:
- Check pattern match
- Verify philosophical fit
- Test resonance
- Ensure distinctiveness
## Application Process
1. For Overall Archetype:
\`\`\`
a) Analyze full pattern across domains
b) Identify dominant tendencies
c) Select appropriate elements
d) Test combination
e) Verify fit
\`\`\`
2. For Domain Archetypes:
\`\`\`
a) Analyze specific pattern
b) Consider domain context
c) Select domain-appropriate elements
d) Test combination
e) Verify domain fit
\`\`\`
3. Quality Control:
\`\`\`
a) Verify distinctiveness
b) Test resonance
c) Confirm accuracy
\`\`\`
Remember: Archetypes should be both meaningful
