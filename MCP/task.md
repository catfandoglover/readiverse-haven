# DNA Assessment AI Assistant Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented an AI assistant system to help users explore philosophical questions in the DNA assessment. The assistant (named Virgil) provides a conversational interface where users can discuss and reflect on the current question they're considering.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Context-Aware Conversations**: 
   - The AI assistant is now aware of the current philosophical question being shown to the user
   - When a user changes to a new question, the system creates a fresh conversation with new context

2. **Dynamic Conversation Starters**:
   - Added a system that selects a random philosophical prompt from a curated list when starting a new conversation
   - Each new question gets a different conversation starter to keep the experience fresh
   - Prompts are designed to be open-ended and encourage thoughtful reflection

3. **Audio Response System**:
   - All AI assistant responses are automatically converted to speech using AWS Polly
   - Implemented auto-play functionality so audio responses begin playing immediately
   - Users can manually pause/play audio responses as needed

4. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Connected the frontend to a Node.js server that handles real-time communication with AI services
   - Server manages conversation sessions and ensures contextual awareness

5. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Clear visual indicators when the AI is processing responses
   - Support for both text and voice input from users
   - Mobile-friendly interface with floating AI chat button

## Technical Details

### Client-Side Components:
- `AIChatButton.tsx`: Floating button component for accessing the AI assistant
- `AIChatDialog.tsx`: Dialog component that contains the chat interface
- `ChatMessage.tsx`: Component for rendering individual messages with audio playback

### Server-Side Components:
- `server.js`: WebSocket server that handles real-time communication with AI services
- Added AWS Polly integration for high-quality voice synthesis

### Services:
- `AIService.ts`: Client-side service for managing AI interactions
- `SpeechService.ts`: Handles speech synthesis and audio processing
- `ConversationManager.ts`: Maintains conversation context across interactions

## Current Status
The AI assistant now successfully provides contextual guidance for users exploring philosophical questions in the DNA assessment. It offers thoughtful prompts based on the specific question being considered and automatically plays audio responses to create a more engaging experience.

## Future Improvements
- Add voice style customization options
- Implement conversation history saving
- Add more sophisticated context management to track user's philosophical leanings
