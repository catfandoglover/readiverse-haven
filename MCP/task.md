Alright. So I have this example of a telegram bot. That replies to users Questions basically helping them take a survey. And it's working how I want it. It's just was created as a sort of demo of how this works, and now I wanna move this functionality into my main White It's react up, I don't I wanted to use the actual questions from that React app not the questions that I put into Telegram. But it should work the same way. It should always do the greeting the first question. For the the first time opened. And then should reply I've mentioned it Should All analyzing the current question, keeping in mind the users, history. I wanna port this over this functionality over to my actual React app, but I don't wanna keep the questions I Claude in Telegram because I'm just gonna use the exact survey questions as they appear. So that's the React app is what dictates the current question You'll see but I want everything else to work. I want it to reply to messages, using text and from Gemini, but also a voice version of that using Amazon Polly. So that's the goal. I'm gonna link you 2 the Amazon Poly, and you do the rest.

here’s the code to the telegram bot: /Users/philip.galebach/coding-projects/alexandria/virgil_bot/virgil_example.py

remember there’s a .env file with all the api keys you need.
