# Desktop View Redesign Implementation for Discover Feeds

## Tasks Completed

1. ✅ Updated `useIsMobile` hook to reliably determine viewport size
2. ✅ Redesigned `ContentCard` component with:
   - Mobile view (unchanged)
   - Desktop view (horizontal card layout)
3. ✅ Updated feed pages with responsive layouts:
   - IconsFeedPage
   - ClassicsFeedPage
   - ConceptsFeedPage
4. ✅ Updated DiscoverLayout for better responsiveness
5. ✅ Added desktop-specific enhancements:
   - Larger text sizes
   - Better spacing and typography
   - Hover effects for interactive elements
   - Improved navigation controls positioning

## Implementation Details

- **Media Breakpoint**: Mobile/desktop transition at 768px
- **Layout Strategy**: Conditional rendering based on `useIsMobile` hook
- **Mobile Experience**: Completely preserved - no changes to mobile view
- **Desktop Layout**: Horizontal cards with image on left, content on right
- **Content Formatting**: Consistent with existing designs but optimized for horizontal layout

## Impact

The updated design provides a better experience for desktop users while maintaining the existing mobile experience. Desktop users now have a more spacious, readable layout appropriate for larger screens without any compromise to the mobile experience.
