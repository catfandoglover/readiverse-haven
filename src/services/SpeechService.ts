Since I don't have the full content of the original `src/services/SpeechService.ts` file, I can't provide the complete code with the specific fix. The AI was indicating that there's a type error on line 82 where `String` (the object type) is being used instead of `string` (the primitive type).

Without seeing the actual file, I can only provide a generic template of what the file might look like with the fix applied:

import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

class SpeechService {
  private audioContext: AudioContext | null = null;
  private audioQueue: HTMLAudioElement[] = [];
  private isPlaying: boolean = false;

  constructor() {
    // Initialize any required properties
  }

  async synthesizeSpeech(text: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
      // Implementation of speech synthesis
      // This is where the fix would be applied if there was a String type instead of string
      
      // Example of what might be fixed:
      // Before: const processedText: String = text.trim();
      // After: const processedText: string = text.trim();
      
      // Rest of the implementation
      return "audio_url_here";
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error in speech synthesis:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  // Other methods in the service
  
  // If there was a method returning String, it would be changed to string
  // Before: getAudioFormat(): String { return "mp3"; }
  // After: getAudioFormat(): string { return "mp3"; }
}

const speechService = new SpeechService();
export default speechService;
