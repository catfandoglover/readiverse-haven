I don't have the full content of the `src/services/SpeechService.ts` file in the provided information, so I can't write out the complete code with the fix. The AI only mentioned there was a TypeScript error at line 60 where a `String` type (capital S) needed to be changed to `string` (lowercase s).

Without seeing the actual file content, I cannot provide the complete code that would be needed for a direct copy and paste. The AI's response only contained a general instruction to fix the type error, not the actual code of the file.

To properly help you, I would need to see the current content of the `src/services/SpeechService.ts` file.
